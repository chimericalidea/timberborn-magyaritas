## Update the Hungarian translation
1. Open AssetRipper [download here](https://assetripper.github.io/AssetRipper/articles/Downloads.htm)
2. Open *Timberborn/Timberborn_Data* folder
3. Search page for "enUS" and open it (click the name which is found in the third column)
4. Go to text tab
5. Scroll to bottom and click save
   
Now we need to compare this file to the enUS file for the last translation

6. In Notepad++ (or tool of your choice), open both files.
7. To show both files on the same screen, right click on the tab, click "move document", click "move to other view".
8. In the top menu bar, open "plugins", enable the "compare" plugin. (Plugins, Plugins Admin, search "compare", click on it, click Install).
9. Plugins, Compare (or CTRL+ALT+C)

Once you've identified all the fileds that have been added, you need to add these to the huHU file. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Make sure you've downloaded the latest version of the mod!

10.  Open huHU in GitHub (huHU, Localizations, huHU.csv) and click the pencil in top right to edit.
11.  For the first new field, copy the entire row from enUS. Search huHU for the value in the first column (columns are separated by commas) for the row above and paste the new row after it. (This keeps the order the same.)
12.  Translate the 3rd column.
13.  Scroll up and click the green "Commit changes" button
14.  add change notes of which fields were added, changed, removed.
